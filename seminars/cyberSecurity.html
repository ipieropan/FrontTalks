						<h1>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h1>
						<p>
							Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems,
							networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and
							damage. As the world becomes more interconnected through digital
							platforms, cybersecurity plays a vital role in ensuring the safety
							and integrity of sensitive information, whether it's personal
							data, corporate information, or government secrets.

						<h2>Key Aspects of Cybersecurity:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Data Protection:</strong> A major focus of cybersecurity
								is to secure data from breaches and leaks. This involves using
								encryption, secure storage practices, and protocols to keep
								sensitive information private.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Network Security:</strong> This area deals with
								protecting a network's infrastructure from attacks like malware,
								ransomware, and phishing. It involves firewalls, intrusion
								detection systems (IDS), and other technologies to safeguard
								data as it moves through networks.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Application Security:</strong> Securing applications to
								prevent vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit. This
								includes practices like secure coding, regular updates, and
								vulnerability assessments.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Information Security (InfoSec):</strong> InfoSec is
								broader than just cybersecurity and involves protecting
								information assets, whether they are digital, physical, or
								otherwise, from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong> Ensures
								that only authorized users have access to certain information
								and systems. IAM systems manage user identities and access
								privileges through techniques like multi-factor authentication
								(MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC).
